What is API.dir?
--------------------------
* Provide a platform to manage OpenAPI Specs. Organizations can use it to publish API internally. I plan to explore the 
opportunity to host public API's from various companies and developers in the future. 
* I intend to integrate with various tools related to OpenAPI. For example, code generation, test scripts, etc.
* Allow code tutorials to be uploaded
